# Selfish

“Throw me the idol, I’ll throw you the whip!” 
-That jerk from the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark 

There is only one true concern in a selfish character’s life: themselves.  Every action they take will be weighed against their own self-interests.  If it doesn’t benefit them, they simply won’t do it.  

Selfish characters are not always completely evil.  It will often be in their best interest to defeat a bad guy bent on destroying the world… mostly because the world is where they are currently living and also where they keep all their stuff.

# Righteous

Omar: I mean, I do some dirt, too, but I ain't never put my gun on nobody that wasn't in the game.
Bunk: A man must have a code.
Omar: Oh, no doubt.
-_The Wire_

Righteous characters tend to think of others before themselves and are usually concerned with “doing the right thing” despite what it could mean for their own goals or personal well-being.  They are boy scouts, peace officers, and are generally what you think of when you hear the word “hero.”  

This is not to say that righteous characters are always “good.”  Some of history’s greatest monsters perpetrated great crimes and went to their graves believing they were doing mankind a great service.  No one ever truly believes they are the villain of their own story.

# Wild

“It’s Showtime.”
-Beetlejuice

Wild Characters are unpredictable and will often do things that, to others, seem foolish or short-sighted.  That could be true, or they could be doing the one thing that could save the entire team.  You Just. Don’t. Know.

They are neither “good” nor “bad” but instead a neutral force of nature and will likely create friction in any group that will have them.  Wild characters range from simply “untamable” allies who follow their own rules or truly chaotic agents of chance.

While role playing a Wild Character, it may be beneficial to flip a coin or roll a D2 to decide a course of action.

# Calculating

“Logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” 
-Spock in Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan

Calculating characters carefully consider the pros and cons of their actions before proceeding.  Nothing they do is rash, ill-considered, or impulsive.  What they lack in speed and passion, they make up in efficiency and intellectual superiority.  

That said, calculating characters are not always a buzzkill.  They will often gladly raise their battle-ax and storm the castle with the rest of their party… but only after thoroughly examining any other possible solutions like sneaking in quietly, opening diplomatic channels, or just taking a nap instead.

# Passionate

“My name is Inigo Montoya.  You killed my father.  Prepare to die.”
-Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride

Passionate characters follow their hearts. They live in the moment and trust their instincts when it comes to making important decisions in life and love.  They can be impulsive, quick-tempered, and easily swayed by emotional appeals.  But when they join your cause, you can be rest assured that a Passionate character will stay with you to the bitter end and always give you 100 percent.

That said, passionate characters are not necessarily whimsical flakes.  Passion can also be channeled into dedication. It takes a great deal of passion to consider becoming the greatest bowman who ever lived or dedicate your life to seeking revenge on the criminals who killed your fiancé.

# Fighter
Fighters are much stronger than the average human.  They can lift, push, pull, and throw items with strength comparable to an olympic athlete.  For more difficult tasks, a D20 roll may be requested.

-----
# Marksman
Marksmen are very fast and light on their feet.  They have the speed and agility of an Olympic runner or gymnast.  For more difficult, superhuman efforts, a D20 roll may be required.

-----
# Witch Doctor
Witch Doctor channel their mystical abilities through a small personal token or weapon.  Keep this on you at all times.

Witch Doctor can channel and adjust the powerful unseen forces of nature that control all life in the universe.  Wise witch doctors are careful about where, when, and how they use their abilities as playing with forces they can (at best) barely understand will often have unintended consequences…

Witch Doctors are skilled at figuring things out about the people, places, and things they observe and interact with on a daily basis.  They have the deductive reasoning skills (and social graces) of your average socially awkward but brilliant title character of a weekly detective or medical TV series.  You can often determine, at a glance, whether someone or something is harmful or friendly.  More difficult subjects may require a D20 roll.

-----
# Wizard
Wizards are smarter than the average human.  They possess intelligence on par with your average multi-day Jeopardy Champion. They can identify unknown objects, places, famous people, and monsters.  A D20 roll may be required for more difficult subjects.

-----
# Animal Trainer
* You have a pet! It can be any animal you wish, but keep it smaller than a black bear. Keep in mind the animal you choose will limit your ability to, say, stay inside an inn. A scary animal, like a dragon, may perturb NPCs.
* You also travel with 3 empty kennels. One of them is occupied by your starter pet, but the others are for any new pets you may pick up.

-----
# Criminal
* Your actions will determine whether or not society is aware of your criminal tendencies. Anonymity has obvious benefits. However, being a famous criminal will lead to making underworld contacts and lawman enemies. Tread cautiously.
* Burglars carry a small pack of 5 items to help them with their crimes. Decide what items you bring with you when you roll the character.  Grappling hooks, lock picks, stethoscopes for safecracking, smoke bombs, etc. Should all fit in a nondescript backpack.

-----
# Diplomat
* You are usually the party spokesman. Authorities you encounter will prefer to deal with you.
* Diplomats are great at passing bribes! Everyone has a price. Just ask. Hopefully you have enough spare cash to make something happen.
* OPTIONAL: Your character may act as a representative of a foreign power or even a member of royalty. As such, you will earn a regular wage as agreed upon by you and the GM.

----
# Merchant

* Merchants are in this adventuring game for the money.   They will usually ONLY take a job if a fee is involved.  If they are forced to work pro bono, their heart isn’t really in it and may take skill roll penalties.
* Merchants travel with a cart of goods.  Your cart can hold up to 10 regular quality items that are good enough to sell, but won’t really help you with your adventuring.  You start with 5 items of your choosing.  GM determines value.
* Your Merchant can sell items in their cart to NPCs they meet.  Sales will have to make logical sense.  The captain of the guard (probably) doesn’t want that tea set you’re peddling and the farmer you meet on your travels won’t need a great war axe.

-----
# Performer
* Performers in costume cannot carry conspicuous armor or weapons.  You leave any items that cannot be concealed behind when in costume.
* Performers travel with a costume trunk.  Before you set off on your adventure, discuss with the GM what 5 costumes you want to take with you.  You can replace them with others you find off corpses, pick up in shops, or create on your journey.
* Performers can earn money by singing in bars or busking in town squares.

-----
# Priest
* You are a member of the clergy.  This affords you a level of respect among godfearing types.  Your friends may be forced to sleep in the barn, but not you!
* Design your own religion!  Do you follow a sea god?  Goddess of the hunt?  Your god works in mysterious ways.  You may find various skill rolls get a bonus if you are in a location or situation that fits into your backstory!

#### Choose One Taboo from the list below. These actions are forbidden to your priest:
* Verbal Communication or business dealings with non-clergy members of opposite gender.  Allies are excluded, but you should RP this a little
* Lying.  You cannot lie to anyone ever.  If your group is attempting a deception, you can not help them in any way.
* Use of potions, medicines, bandages, or non-holy equipment items of any kind
* Harming non-humanoid non-evil animals.  You cannot do any damage to animals in combat.  If you are the last one alive and surrounded by wolves, you must flee and fail combat.
* Earning Gold Coins.  This character earns NO money.  Any Gold Coins given to this character are immediately “dispersed to the poor”

-----
# Scout
* Scouts CANNOT carry or equip items that make noise or create light and still use their scout abilities.

-----
# Soldier
* Orders- All soldiers have orders as you are part of a military organization.  Before you start the game, determine what your standing orders are.  You should try to follow these orders throughout your game experience, or else you may find yourself becoming an ex-soldier very soon.
* Fellow Soldiers- Stationed in towns and outposts, you may encounter fellow soldiers who follow the same banner as you.  If you outrank them, you can give them simple non-combat instructions.  If they outrank YOU, you must follow their orders or face disciplinary action.
* Wages-  Soldiers receive a regular wage from their military organization.
* Discharge- Too many disciplinary actions, and you may be kicked out.  If so, you are now a MERCENARY.  You still have all of your soldier abilities, except you no longer follow orders, you no longer receive wages, and if you want to Marshal Forces, you have to pay them out of pocket.

-----
# Tinkerer
* If your party travels in a steampunk contraption, odds are your tinkerer owns or pilots it.
* Tinkerers carry around a small toolbox that can contain 5 tools used to make repairs and build small machines.  Determine what your tools are before you travel.  You can replace broken or useless tools at a shop or with items you find in your journeys.

-----
# Warlock
You commune with dark forces, so most respectable NPCs will not be disposed towards treating you kindly.  You will rarely, if ever, be able to apply for odd jobs.  Pets will growl at you.
