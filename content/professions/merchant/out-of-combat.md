# Identify Sellable Item
### Post-Combat

Merchants are capable of finding diamonds in the rough and can find treasure in items most adventurers would overlook.  So if you find an item or set of items that on first glance have no value, give them a once over with this ability before leaving them behind.

#### Roll a D20

* _1-6_ It’s actual junk.  You can take it with you, but it will be difficult to sell.
* _7-17_  You find one or two decent items you can add to your stock.  Roll determines value.
* _19-20_   You find a valuable treasure that is actually decent enough to use in your adventures.
