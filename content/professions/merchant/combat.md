Summon your small 1x2 Merchant Cart onto the battlefield.  It has 15 HP and can move 2 squares on your turn.  It cannot be healed nor can it traverse difficult terrain features.

Up to two players can hide inside the cart.  Once inside, players are immune to damage, but cannot use offensive or ranged abilities.

It can only be summoned once per combat encounter.
