# Domesticate
### Once per day

Attempt to domesticate a non-aggressive wild animal you encounter.  

#### Roll a D4 on your first day
#### D6 on second day
#### D8 on the last, as necessary. 

Wild animals in the midst of training must be kept in a kennel.  If the animal is not trained on that last attempt, it is untrainable and must be freed

* _1_ YOW!  It bit you!  One of your items is randomly damaged and cannot be used until you get it repaired.
* _2-3_ The animal does not respond to your attempts at training.
* _4+_  You successfully train the animal.  It is now your pet, provided you have a kennel for it.
