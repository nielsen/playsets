# Knowledge - Battle Strategy

Soldiers are experts at sizing up a location and assessing the best way to utilize their surroundings to achieve an advantage.

#### Roll a D4.

* _1_ You can tell where the enemy will most likely attack from.  Or, if you can already see enemies, where hidden bad guys are most likely to be found.
* _2_ You can tell where there are spots of good defensive cover.  Or poor cover.  Like a wobbly table or a rug right underneath a shaky chandelier.
* _3_ You spy 1 hidden trap.  Or confirm there are no traps in the area.
* _4_ Choose any of the above.

# Marshal Forces

Attempt to organize a group of local military officials or guards to perform a complex, non-combat related task.  Form a posse, a bucket brigade, or an anti-riot squad.  If it’s a job for a handful of redshirts, you can get it going and lead the way.

#### Roll a D6
* _1_   Whoops.  Your target outranks you.  Now YOU are the one who’ll be taking orders here, Mister.
* _2-5_ You gain the rolled amount of redshirt minions, prepared to take your orders.
* _6_   As many dudes as you need to get the job done appear, within reason.
