There is no weapon in the world you cannot wield.  Steal a weapon from an enemy and use it against them!  Cannot be used against Elite Enemies or enemies who are not carrying weapons.

Roll a D20

* _1_   You yank the weapon out of their hand, but fall over backward and hit yourself with it.  Lose D6 life.
* _2-8_ You get into a tug of war match with the enemy over the weapon.  Both of you roll D6. You exchange damage.  The person with the highest roll “keeps” the weapon.
* _9-18_  You steal their weapon.  You can now use any special attacks that weapon may bestow.
* _19-20_ You steal their weapon and immediately kill them with it.  Violently.

You may only have one stolen weapon on you at a time.
