# Miracle! (Defensive)
### 1 ENERGY
### No Range

When an enemy is about to attack you, pray to the heavens to spare your life.  Hey, it may actually workâ€¦

NOTE: You can only play this once per turn.

#### Roll a D100

* _1-85_  Like what happens with most prayers, nothing happens.
* _86-99_ The attack misses completely!  This is clearly due to divine intervention!
* _100_ You are infused with the spirit of a powerful celestial being for the remainder of the encounter.  Your life is healed to full and you can attack with a mighty celestial blade for 2 Energy that does D100 damage.

# Convert (Defensive)
### 4 ENERGY
### Adjacent

Attempt to convince an enemy to repent their evil ways after they have injured you

#### Roll a D10.
Compare your roll to the TOTAL amount of damage a SINGLE non-elite enemy has inflicted upon you in the current battle.
* _Equal or Lower_  The enemy regrets their actions and will now fight on your side.
* _Higher_    No regrets.  The enemy resents your attempts to appeal to their better angels.  They will DEFINITELY be attacking you on their next turn.

You can only successfully convert one enemy per encounter.
