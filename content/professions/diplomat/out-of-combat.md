# Knowledge - Detect Motives

You are very skilled at assessing a situation and understanding what people want.  You can often tell just by looking at someone what they’re really like… even if they are trying to deceive you.

#### Roll a D4

* _1_ You determine whether or not a person is being honest.
* _2_ You understand their motives.
* _3_   You understand what they desire.
* _4_ If an NPC is harboring a secret, you get at least a clue as to what it may be…

# Bribe

Attempt to get your way with a monetary bribe.  If the NPC is open to accepting a bribe from you for a reasonable action, roll a die:

#### Roll a D2 if they like you
#### Roll a D4 if they are neutral
#### Roll a D6 if they dislike you

* Roll determines how much money the bribe will cost you.  Feel free to pass the hat around your party to help pay for this.
