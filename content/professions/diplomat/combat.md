# Persuade
### 5 ENERGY
### Adjacent

ONCE per battle, you can attempt to convince a non-elite minion to fight for you.  

#### Roll a D20
#### Modifications: Convincing RPs, actual monetary bribes.

* _1-2_ Failure.  That monster is insulted and will only attack you
* _3-6_ Confuse.  The monster is confused by your argument.  It will not attack you this turn.
* _7-19_  Success.  The monster fights for you.  You give it verbal instructions.  Stay in earshot (6 squares) or it’ll ignore you and do its own thing.
* _20_    Congrats.  You now have a pet.  Give it a name (unless it’s a humanoid and it will likely already have one). It will come into battle with you until it dies (or you release it) and it will follow any instructions you give it, regardless of distance.  NOTE: If you have a Persuasion Pet, you CANNOT persuade another minion until your old pet is released or killed.
