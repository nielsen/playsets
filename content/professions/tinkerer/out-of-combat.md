# Knowledge - Repair Machine

If something is broken, your tinkerer probably knows what is wrong with it and, if possible, how to fix it.
#### Roll a D20.
Add a modifier if you have an appropriate tool for the job.
* _~1_  It’s reaaaaally broken.  Will take several days to repair.
* _~10_ You can probably get this thing up and going in an hour or so.  You may need an additional component to complete.
* _~20_ You turn a screw and it’s basically good as new.

# Macguyver

You can create small, interesting machines or gizmos out of 2-3 simple found objects in the immediate area.  Like Macguyver.  A Tranq dart gun made out of rolled up parchment, a nearby toadstool, and a sewing needle?  Sounds great.  Whatever you imagine, as long as it makes fantasy RPG sense.  Spyglass yes, briefcase nuke no.

Search the immediate area for the components you need. GM assigns number based on RP and likelihood of finding the object.

#### Roll a D10
* If you roll OVER the number, you find the item.
* If the items you need can be reasonably found, like leaves in a forest or a garbage can in a city street, no roll is required.
* You can use any item in your toolbox for no roll.

Your tinkerer can keep up to 2 successfully created simple machines to use later.  Every time you use the machine, roll a D6.  If you roll a 1, it breaks.
