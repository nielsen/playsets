# Assassinate

Hey. It’s a dirty business, but someone’s gotta do it. And blood washes off of leather, right?

#### Roll a d20 against a target's awareness out of combat, and another d20 to do catastrophic damage to them.

# Pick Lock

Attempt to open a sealed chest, door, or lock.

#### Roll a D20 for a simple lock
#### Roll a D12 for a normal lock
#### Roll a D10 for a complex lock
* _1-4_   Lockpick breaks in lock.  Door/chest cannot be opened.
* _5-7_   Your first attempt fails.  You can try it again, but if this is time sensitive, be careful.

* _12+_   Lock opens.  In addition to scripted items, the Criminal also finds some money.

# Mastermind

You know where to go if, uh, there are some, maybe, interestingly acquired items need to be fenced. How to infiltrate an organization. Spy and go all Benedict Arnold on their asses. You plot and scheme like the best of them.

#### Roll a d20 against the difficulty of being a criminal badass.
