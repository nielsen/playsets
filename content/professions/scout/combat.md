# Stealth
### 5 ENERGY
### Self

Blend into your surroundings and go invisible to enemies.
#### Roll a D6
* If you roll EQUAL TO OR LOWER than the distance between you and the nearest enemy, you succeed in going stealth.
* If you roll HIGHER, you fail, but you are harder to see and the next attack on you will deal 1 less damage.

While in stealth, enemies may not attack you.  If you are still in stealth on an enemy’s turn and they walk next to you, stealth is removed.

Attacking, healing, or performing defensive actions will remove stealth.  HOWEVER, your first attack out of stealth does x2 damage as an Ambush.
