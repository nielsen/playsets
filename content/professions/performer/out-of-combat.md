# Disguise

Attempt to impersonate either a specific NPC (The King, a famous criminal) or a type of NPC (A guard, a fancy courtesan) for purposes of deception.

When your costume is created, the GM will rate it from 1 to 6.  A cobbled together guard uniform may only be a 2 or 3.  But if you knock out a guard and take his uniform, that will likely be a 5 or 6.

#### Roll a D6 when attempting to fool a person or roomful of persons as to your identity.  Compare to Quality Value.

* _Lower or Equal_ You fool everyone.  You are as you appear to be.
* _Higher_  They see through your costume immediately or become suspicious.  Time to find an exit.
