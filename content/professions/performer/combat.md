# Compose Song/Poem
### 1 ENERGY PER TURN
### Range 4

Sing a song about the current battle.  You will actually be composing this song during combat, so keep a notepad nearby.  You MUST add a new line per turn and there should be some kind of proper form or rhyming scheme.

#### Different kinds of lines have different effects. If a line qualifies for multiple effects, choose one:
* Lines that describe SPECIFIC ENEMY ACTIONS  result in that enemy doing half damage this turn.
* Lines about SPECIFIC ALLY ACTIONS in range heals them D4+1 HP
* Lines about YOURSELF result in a refund of energy, but no effect, you egomaniac...
* Insulting an enemy has no concrete effect, but they may be more inclined to attack you…
