# Skill Checks

There are no skill checks. Anything an athletic adult can do, your players can do.  Complicated actions requiring the strength of athletes or the intelligence of a college graduate or the experience of a trained diplomat are covered in character/job descriptions.

# Perception
There is no such thing as general “Perception” or perception checks.  
It is assumed that you can see and understand things that an average person can see.
You can examine anything in the world using your player’s inherent class/job knowledge.  The GM may ask you to roll a D20 to see how well you did.

# Armor
Your character is always assumed to be wearing armor.  If for some reason they have their armor removed (Jail, drugged, stolen by thieves in the night) players reduce their total HP by 10.

# Weapons
Likewise, your character is assumed to have their weapons on them at all times.  If for some reason the weapon is removed, players can physically attack for D4 damage.

# Energy   
Each player has 10 energy.  Energy can be used for attacks, movement, or general actions.

Energy is always refunded at the START of that player’s turn.  Energy can not be given or shared between players.


# Combat Actions

These actions are described in detail on each character’s class and job page.  

Regular Combat Actions can only be performed ONCE per turn.  
Defensive Combat Actions can be performed as many times as you wish.

# General Actions

In addition to your class combat actions, you can perform a variety of general actions.  
As with regular combat actions actions, you can only perform a specific action ONCE per turn.

* Drink a potion: 1 energy
* Picking an item up: 1 energy
* Push a button/pull a lever: 1 energy
* Throw an item: 2 energy per 3 squares

# Movement Actions

* Standard Move: 1 energy per square.
* Climbing a wall: 1 energy per 5 feet.
* Horizontal Leap: 3 energy per 1 square.
* Swimming: 2 Energy per square in calm water, 3 in a current.  
* Carrying a heavy item: 3 energy per square 

# Entering Combat

When combat begins, players roll a D20 against the level of combat preparedness of the enemies.  It is up to GM discretion to determine the difficulty of the roll or if he will just participate in the roll himself.

If ANY player rolls highest, the players ALL go first before the monsters.  The high rolling player decides turn order.  

If the GM wins, the monsters go first.  Players have HALF energy to use for defensive abilities.

ONLY Marksmen can attempt a combat ability before combat is declared with their “Ask Questions Later” ability

# Combat Order

Once order is determined, players go through their individual turns one by one.  Most abilities must be done on a player’s turn, but defensive abilities can be performed whenever.

# Knocked Out
When a player reaches 0 HP, the player turns into a ghost.  Just because you are “dead” does not mean you are done playing Each class has a special ghost ability they can perform on their turn.

# Death
There is no permanent death in Simplequest.  Dead players are returned to life at the end of combat.  They lose ONE item of the GM’s choice that was damaged in the brutal attack that almost ended their life.

If GMs INSIST on playing with perma-death, we suggest implementing a “3 Strikes and you’re  out” rule as we do not have a complicated “bleeding out” system to allow players to save themselves in-combat.

# Money

Players will earn small sums of money that are exclusively spent on items in stores.  For RP purposes, players should behave according to their character backgrounds.  Well off players can stay in the inn.  Poor players sleep in the barn.

# Fire

Fire hot.  Fire hurts.  Fire in combat will do 2 damage to adjacent enemies or players if they END their turn adjacent to it.  If a player stands in fire, they take 3 damage.

Fire can spread if in a flammable area.

# House Rules

Simplequest does away with a lot of favorite game mechanics, largely in the interest of simplicity.  That said, you can add your own familiar layers of complexity if you just can’t live without them.  Some examples:

* Skill Checks.  If you want there to be an element of randomness in general skill checks, assigning a difficulty between 1-20 and then having the player roll a D20 should work fine.
