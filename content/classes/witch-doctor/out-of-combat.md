# Bad Luck

Your mystical abilities have a negative impact on nearby small machines and man-made physical objects.   You can cause hammerheads to fall off, furnaces to clog, small ropes to snap, and strip gears in clocks.

#### Roll a D8

* _1-2_ Failure.  The object withstands your attempt.  
* _3-6_ The object breaks.  The GM will take your roll amount in consideration to determine severity of the damage.
* _7_ The object breaks in a comically obvious way.  This will likely draw some suspicion.
* _8_ Haywire.  Windows shatter, chairs snap, glasses break in a several yard radius.  This will definitely draw attention to you.

# Heal

Attempt to heal an injured or ailing NPC.

#### Roll a D12 if target is ill enough to call out sick
#### Roll a D10 if target is seriously ill
#### Roll a D6 if target is near death

* _1-2_ They take a turn for the worse (or worse!).  If the people who called for your help are superstitious dullards, you will likely be accused of witchcraft.
* _3-5_ They are stabilized, but not out of the woods.  
* _6-9_ They miraculously recover from their ailment.  Your roll value determines how quickly they do so.
* _10-12_ They instantaneously recover from their ailment. You can expect gratitude, rewards, etc.

# Undo Magic

Attempt to remove a persistent magic spell on the board (shields, pain auras, magical traps, cursed items)

* Roll a D20 vs the resilience of the target spell.
* Difficulty increases by **+3** with every failed attempt. 
* If it exceeds 20, you must wait a day to try again.

# Misfortune

You can afflict an NPC with a brief, minor physical ailment of your choosing

EXAMPLES: A bout of sneezing as they give an important speech, tripping over their own two feet as they lead you down the stairs to the dungeon, choking on a big bite of steak at a fancy dinner, etc.

#### Roll a D10 if they are unaware of your presence
#### Roll a D8 if they are aware of your presence
#### Roll a D6 if you have ever used this ability on them before.

* _1_ Haywire.  Everyone within several yards, yourself included, suffers from a severe case of the same malady.   This will draw attention.
* _2-3_ Your hex affects a completely random target.
* _3-5_ It works… possibly a little too well.  They will likely be aware that they are being messed with.
* _6+_  It works and no one is the wiser.

# Exorcism

If someone is possessed by a demon, under the influence of a foul magical agent, or under the effects of mind control or brainwashing, you can restore them.  

WARNING: Attempting an exorcism on an unaffiliated target may cause brain damage.  Also, an extracted demon or spirit will be less than thrilled by your actions…

#### Roll a D8. You gain a roll bonus depending on the amount of advance knowledge you have of what is causing the affliction.

* _1-3_ The victim is beyond your help.  
* _4-7_ The malady is removed.  Your roll value determines how injured the victim may be.
* _8_ The victim is cured and totally fine.

# Jedi Mind Trick

Attempt to convince a friendly, non-suspicious, non-agitated NPC of a simple but obvious falsehood.  “You should let us go!”  “These are not the droids you’re looking for.”  Complex concepts like “You should come with us to the magical forest to help us find the forest troll” will not work.

#### D8 for a highly intelligent person.  
#### D10 for a person of average intelligence.  
#### D12 for a fool.

* _1-2_   Epic Failure.  Not only does it not work, but they are aware you tried to dupe them with magic.
* _3-5_   Regular failure.  They are unaware you tried to dupe them.  
* _6+_  Success.  They believe your statement as if it were absolute truth.

# Out of Combat Heal

You can heal your party ONCE when a combat encounter ends.  Useful for dungeons or dangerous areas where resting is not an option.

#### Roll a D20

Distribute the rolled amount among your party members as you see fit.
