# Slice
Your sword can cut things like simple ropes, fruit, and thin pieces of wood. No roll required for simple items.
#### For more difficult cuts, like a metal chain, roll a D8
* _1-5_ Failure
* _6-8_ Success

-----

# Pin
You possess the strength to subdue a regular humanoid, including members of your own team!
#### Roll a D12 for a regular humanoid or a Mage/Marksman PC.
#### Roll a D8 for an elite humanoid or a fellow Warrior PC.
* _1-4_ They break free of your attempt to hold them in place.
* _5-8_ You succeed in holding them in place for up to a minute.  Anything longer than that and you’re going to need cuffs or rope.
* _9-12_  You can put them in sleeper hold, if you want, and knock them unconscious.  If you want.

# Upper Hand
Your deadly combination of great strength and lightning reflexes allow you to quickly gain the upper hand on an NPC.  Turn a simple handshake into a grappling hold.  Resist arrest by flipping shackles on your jailor.  RP for a bonus. Extremely strong NPCs can result in a negative roll.
#### Roll a D20
* _1-4_   Great failure.  You injure yourself in the attempt.
* _5-7_   You are evenly matched.  You are now grappling with your opponent.
* _8-19_  Success.  Whatever you attempted to describe happened.
* _20+_   Unintended success.  Something else happens you didn’t expect.  Usually positive.

-----

# Chop
You can fell small trees.  Or knock out wooden support beams or lampposts.  
#### Roll a D6
* _1-2_ You fail.  If this event is not time sensitive, you can attempt another round of chopping at +1 and assume it takes another 5-10 minutes.
* _3-6_ You succeed at chopping down whatever you’re trying to knock down.

-----

# Door Bash
Locked door in your way?  Attempt to knock it down with your brute strength.
#### D20 for a standard wooden door, D12 for a barred wooden door, D10 for a metal door.  Note: This will create a loud noise.
* _1-6_ The door holds, despite your best efforts. You swear this never happens to you.
* _7-9_ The door breaks allowing entry.
* _10+_   The door explodes, injuring or startling any NPCs that may be inside.

-----

# Distract
Attempt to gain the attention of an NPC or group of NPCs to allow a fellow player to do something unseen (pick a pocket, unlock a door, steal documents from a desk).
#### Roll a D10 to distract a single NPC, D8 to distract a small group, D6 for a large crowd.
* _1-3_ You fail to gain the attention of the target.
* _4-5_ You succeed at gaining their attention for about 15 seconds.
* _6+_  You can keep a group enthralled for several minutes.

-----

# Repair

Let’s be honest: You get your weapons. They are closer than family.

#### Roll a d20 against the damage sustained to a weapon (from hitting a magically sealed door or an iron golem).

* _1_ You made it worse. Leave this to the professionals, and the difficulty increases by **+3**. If in excess of 20, try again tomorrow, or when you get new materials.
* _Less than_ means you didn’t fix it, but you likely didn’t make it any worse.
* _Equal to or exceeds less than 5_ means you patched it up; there’s a **5%** chance per battle it’ll be broken until you fix it up professionally.
* _Exceeds by 6 or more_ means you’re a goddamn genius with some bubblegum and bailing twine. Well done, sir-or-madam. Brand-spanking new.
