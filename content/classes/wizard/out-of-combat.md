# Reverse Morph

Turn a small barnyard or woodland creature into a humanoid of your choice.  The enchantment lasts for about an hour.
#### Roll a D20

* _1_   Reversal!  You are now transformed into an animal instead for 24 hours!
* _2-19_  You are successful.  The higher the roll, the more they are likely to pass for human, the longer the enchantment lasts, and their willingness and ability to follow commands.
* _20_    The Full Fairy Tale- The animal is now human forever.

# Storm

Make it rain!  Must be outside.

#### Roll a D20

* _1-8_ Your attempt to alter the weather fail.
* _9-14_  It starts to rain.
* _15-19_ It starts to storm.  Everyone should probably get inside.
* _20_    A violent and dangerous storm appears.  Bad things happen.  You and your party MUST seek shelter.

# Wand
Your magic wand can do a variety of small parlor tricks, such as:
* Levitating very small objects
* Conjuring food
* Manipulating far away objects as if your hands were there.

-----

# Teleport

You can move at will through space and time about 10-20 yards at a time.  Bypass walls, crowds, jail cell doors, whatever.  As long as you can see where you are going or have already been there.

WARNING: To do so, you must pass through a dimension ruled by some pretty nasty monsters.  So use this ability at your peril.

#### When you teleport, Roll a D20 in secret.

* _1_   You accidentally teleport to a random location.  The GM will let you know where you land, goof.
* _2-19_  It goes off without a hitch.  Nice.
* _20_  You return from the netherrealms with a demon in tow.  It may attack you.  It may not.  It will definitely cause some local problems.

# Illusion

Create an illusion.  You must concentrate on maintaining the illusion spell at all times or it will vanish.  Illusions can be used to explain a concept to, distract, or fool NPCs.  

#### D10 to create a small simple illusion
#### D8 to create a person sized illusion
#### D6 to create an enormous, complicated room sized illusion

* _1-3_ Failure.  You create an image, but it is clearly a magical construct.
* _4-5_ You manage to create a simple illusion that will on first glance appear real, but won’t bear under sustained scrutiny
* _6+_  Your illusion is perfect both sight and sound and will fool a large group of people for a while.

-----

# Flame

You can create a small flame to light torches or set things on fire.  But be careful…  

#### Roll a D20

* _1-2_   You create a small flame… on yourself.  Hope there’s some water nearby.
* _3-15_  You create a small, controllable flame.
* _16-19_ Whoops. Fire goes out of control.  Better find a way to put it out quick before it gets out of hand...
* _20_    You create a huge fireball.  If you are in or near a wooden building or forest it will be an unlivable inferno within minutes.  ALSO, one of the items you our your group possesses are lost to the fire.

-----

# Undo Magic

Attempt to remove a persistent magic spell on the board (shields, pain auras, magical traps, cursed items)

#### Roll a D20 vs the resilience of the target spell.

* Difficulty increases by **+3** with every failed attempt. 
* If it exceeds 20, you must wait a day to try again.

-----

# Knowledge (Arcana)

Your ability to manipulate the mystical forces of the world around you tunes you in to secrets that few others know.

This ability can be used to attempt to identify a rare or unusual magical item, interpret magical sigils, find active magical effects (like traps or alarm spells), etc.

You’re wily. Prove it.
