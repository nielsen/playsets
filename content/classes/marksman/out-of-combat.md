# Shoot Arrow

Arrows can be shot in a variety of non-combat ways.  They can cut a hanging man from a scaffold, hit simple wooden levers to open gates, hunt small delicious animals etc.

#### Roll a D12 to hit a STATIONARY target
#### D8 on a moving target.

* _1_ Spectacular failure.  If there’s a noisy pot to shatter or an innocent bystander, you totally hit it.
* _2-3_ Regular failure.  If there are no witnesses and time is not of the essence, you can try again.
* _4-6_ Success, but you give away your shooting position.
* _7+_  Great success.  If you were trying to be stealthy, nobody noticed.

# Intimidate

You can be pretty scary looking, sharpening your knife, mixing some poisons together.

#### Roll a D20 against some poor NPC's fortitude. 

-----

# Poison Resistance

You’ve spent the last several years working with poisons, allowing you to build up a sort of immunity to them.  Most poisons have no effect on you and even rare or magical poisons require a D20 check to see how effective they are on you.

# Ask Questions Later

You quickly draw your weapon to attack an enemy before they have a chance to react.  This will likely throw you into combat.

#### Roll a D20

* _1-2_   You fumble the weapon and it falls to the floor.  Awkward.  If this action begins combat, you lose 3 energy on your first turn to pick up your weapon again.
* _3-6_   You manage to pull out your weapon and get a shot off.  2 damage and combat begins.
* _7-14_  4 damage and combat begins. 
* _15-19_ 6 damage, combat begins, and you take your turn first.
* _20_    You kill a non-elite enemy instantly.  This maaaaay cause your surviving enemies to re-evaluate the situation and surrender.  If not, you and your party will get to go first once in combat.

# Quick Reflexes

Things happen suddenly in fantasy roleplaying games.  Suddenly, doors burst open.  Suddenly, a boulder crashes through your camp.  Alert Marksmen can avoid these sudden calamities, or start a sudden calamity…

#### Interrupt the GM as he describes non-player activity.  Roll a D20.

* _1-5_   You were caught unawares.  You’re in the same boat as the rest of us, speedy.
* _6-13_  Action rewinds a couple seconds. You can dodge a poison arrow, or dart behind a nearby beam to hide.  Very simple reactionary actions
* _14-20_ Action rewinds a couple seconds.  Time slows down.  You can respond to a sudden action with one of your own.  Guard bursts into the room and can quickly throw a knife to pin his sleeve to a wall.  A child falls out of a burning building across the street, you can dash across and catch them.

# Concealed Knife

You always have a knife on you.  And you’re pretty good with it.  Anything you want to do with that knife (let your sick imagination run wild!) you can probably pull off as long as the knife remains in your hands.  If you want to throw it, see the “Shoot” ability.

But it’s there.  It’s always there. Probably.  

#### If you ever have your gear taken away from you, roll a D20

* _1-4_   Well crap, they found your knife.  Nevermind.
* _5-20_  You still have your knife. Good luck.

# Knowledge - Track

You are pretty handy with a map and compass, or a drunk dwarf’s wine drawing and a magnetized needle. It’s hard for you to get lost, and you can eeriely find the best through the thicket. Oh, and a deer went that way 20 minutes ago.

#### Roll a d20 to determine the quality of your skills.
